# Project Title

Pneumonia Detection using Image processing and Deep learning

# Pneumonia Detection Web App using Django
This is a web application that allows users to upload chest X-ray images and get a prediction of whether the image indicates the presence of pneumonia. The application uses a machine learning model trained on chest X-ray images to make predictions.

# Installation
## Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/n-daiyan27/pneumonia-detection-website.git

## Run database migrations:
    python manage.py migrate
    
## Start the development server:
    python manage.py runserver

The application should now be running at http://localhost:8000/.
